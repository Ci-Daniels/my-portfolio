    <p>
     I am a motivated, adaptable, diligent and responsible undergraduate student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering. 
     <br>I am computer literate; good with Access databasse system, Microsoft publisher and Excel spreadsheets. I also have basic knowledge on Python and C programming languages; not as good but I am learning. I have artistic skills such as sketching, woodwork and some knowledge on metal work too. I also do a little bit of web design.
     <br>I love learning new skills and creating new things. I enjoy writing every once in a while; at the moment working to publish my first book.
     <br>I love order, consistency and a strong drive to see things through completion. A strong believer and upcoming engineer aspiring to provide a more stable state of life through innovation and creation.

           <img src="Automatic Fire Extinguisher.jpg" alt="Automatic Fire Extinguisher" style="width:100%">
           <p>This is an Automatic Fire Extinguisher project,purposely designed for house safety where the main point is to avoid fire accidents which have a great potential to cause damage if not intervened on time.</p>
           <p>In normal times it is not always feasible to rely on human patrol to detect and extinguish fires, as such there is a need to rely on an automated alarming system or extinguishing system incase of an abrupt fire. In order to achieve this we came up with a system to detect and extinguish the fire just on time before damage is caused.</p>

        <div class="Digital Seven Segment Display">
         <img src="Digital Seven Segment Display.jpg" alt="Digital Seven Segment Display" style="width:100%">
         <p>The seven segment display is made of several different illuminating segments, arranged in a way to form numbers and characters by displaying different combinations of segments.</p>
         <p>It can be used in digital calculators, electronic meters, digital clocks and clock radios among others. They are extremely energy efficient and typically low-cost.</p>
         <p>This makes them useful with IoT as there are plenty of battery-powered or self-powered IoT devices. When a seven segemnt sispaly is paired with electrochromic technology, you get an extremely energy efficient display.</p>
